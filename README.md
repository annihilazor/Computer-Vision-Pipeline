# Computer Vision Pipeline — Detection, Segmentation & Real-Time Systems

This repository contains a full end-to-end Computer Vision pipeline built using **OpenCV**, **YOLO**, **UNet**, **RCNN**, and **Roboflow**.  
The project covers everything from classical image processing to modern deep learning–based detection and segmentation.

## 📌 Features

###  1. Classical Computer Vision (OpenCV)
- Image filtering, edge detection, thresholding  
- Motion detection using frame differencing  
- Custom filter design  
- Real-time **Burglar Alarm System** (motion → alert)

###  2. Deep Learning Models
#### 🔹 **YOLO (Object Detection)**
- Suspicious activity detection  
- Bounding box predictions in real time  
- Trained and tested with Roboflow datasets

####  **UNet / RCNN (Segmentation)**
- Instance segmentation pipeline  
- Mask generation and overlay  
- Suitable for medical or industrial CV tasks
